	abstract = {{\textless}div data-language="eng" data-ev-field="abstract"{\textgreater}Maritime accidents are frequent in China, with collisions constituting a significant portion, leading to substantial casualties, financial losses, and environmental harm. Analyzing collision risk is crucial for safe shipping operations, as such accidents arise when multiple risk factors interact beyond certain thresholds. Thus, understanding the coupled relationships among these factors is essential for accident prevention. This study presents a quantitative coupling risk assessment approach for collisions using the N–K model and Bayesian networks (BNs). Through an analysis of 304 accident reports from the China Maritime Safety Administration (CMSA), four primary risk factors (human, ship, environment, and management) are identified. The N–K model quantifies the coupling degree between these factors, while a BN model further elucidates and quantifies the collision risk based on the calculations of N–K model. Validation of the BN model is followed by sensitivity analysis to assess the impact of risk factors on accident occurrence. Subsequently, the method is applied to a case study on collision risk assessment in Chinese waters. Findings indicate that multifactor coupling has a higher occurrence probability than two-factor coupling, with human-ship-environment-management coupling presenting the highest likelihood. Human and management factors emerge as pivotal in collision incidents, while the impact of ship and environmental factors on coupling becomes more pronounced as their probabilities vary. Leveraging the capability of BNs to handle uncertainties and logical relationships, combined with the data-driven N–K model, mitigates subjectivity. The results propose the formulation of risk management strategies and measures for practitioners to enhance maritime safety.{\textless}br/{\textgreater}{\textless}/div{\textgreater} © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

Firstly, through the search, selection and analysis of accident investigation reports of ship collisions in the world, 46 Risk Influential Factors (RIFs) were identified, and a network model for the evolution of ship collision was established. Secondly, a risk analysis of the evolution model for ship collision accidents was conducted by utilizing the topology characteristics of the complex network theory. Thirdly, a robustness analysis was used to identify 10 key RIFs involved in ship collisions from a global network perspective, and the grey relation analysis technique was employed to verify the key RIFs. Finally, the DEMA℡ method was utilized to identify 11 key RIFs from a perspective of causality, and corresponding risk control measures were proposed to mitigate those key RIFs. The research results provide theoretical support for identifying the key RIFs and controlling the risk transmission of ship collision, and have practical significance for preventing the occurrence of ship collision accidents and ensuring the safe navigation of ships.{\textless}br/{\textgreater}{\textless}/div{\textgreater} © 2024 The Authors},

Firstly, the directed distance density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) algorithm was proposed. Based on this algorithm, a multi-ship encounter recognition model was established to cluster ship positions and obtain ship encounter clusters. Subsequently, the multi-ship comprehensive collision risk assessment model was constructed for multi-ship encounter situations based on the hierarchical classification method, enabling the determination of each ship's Comprehensive Collision Risk Value (CCRV). Finally, the collision hotspot recognition model was built using the grid analysis method, which can identify areas with a higher risk of ship collision. The automatic identification system (AIS) data of the Yangtze River estuary were used to validate the effectiveness of our framework. The results show that our framework can accurately measure ship collisions risks and identify areas with high collision risks, offering valuable insights to maritime authorities, providing actionable insights for real-time ship collision risk monitoring.{\textless}br/{\textgreater}{\textless}/div{\textgreater} © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {{\textless}div data-language="eng" data-ev-field="abstract"{\textgreater}A method based on the predictable Transformer network associated with a clustering method is introduced to build a framework for the regional collision risk assessment, which is an alternative to the traditional methods that have two problems: 1) The indicators are calculated based on the current navigation status of ships, not considering the dynamic characteristics and the variability of the ship's trajectory, which makes the calculated indicators inaccurate not allowing an accurate risk assessment. 2) Many deep learning–based algorithms used in ship trajectory prediction are not easy to be trained, as the model structure makes the features unable to be processed in parallel. First, the ships with potential collision risk are clustered by the Density–Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithm to divide the hotspots. Then, the possible locations of ships in the near future are calculated by a multi–step prediction model, i.e., the designed Transformer network. Finally, the ship pairs' collision risk and the regional collision risk are evaluated based on the predicted results. Based on the AIS data from the Yangtze River, the effectiveness of the proposed framework is verified through regional risk assessment for 41 moments and specific interpretation for three moments.{\textless}br/{\textgreater}{\textless}/div{\textgreater} © 2023},

This study proposes a new framework for navigational risk assessment of remotely controlled Maritime Autonomous Surface Ships (MASS). This framework establishes a set of risk influencing factors affecting safety of navigation of a remotely-controlled MASS. Next, model parameters are defined based on the risk factors, and the model structure is developed using Bayesian Networks. To this end, an extensive literature survey is conducted, enhanced with the domain knowledge elicited from the experts and improved by the experimental data obtained during representative MASS model trials carried out in an inland river. Conditional Probability Tables are generated using a new function employing expert feedback regarding Interval Type 2 Fuzzy Sets. The developed Bayesian model yields the expected utilities results representing an accident's probability and consequence, with the results visualized on a dedicated diagram. Finally, the developed risk assessment model is validated by conducting three axiom tests, extreme scenarios analysis, and sensitivity analysis. Navigational environment, natural environment, traffic complexity, and shore-ship collaboration performance are critical from the probability and consequence perspective for inland navigational accidents to a remotely controlled MASS. Lastly, important nodes to Shore-Ship collaboration performance include autonomy of target ships, cyber risk, and transition from other remote control centers.{\textless}br/{\textgreater}{\textless}/div{\textgreater} © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {{\textless}div data-language="eng" data-ev-field="abstract"{\textgreater}Ships are unlikely to share their navigation plans at sea, and officers on watch (OOWs) iteratively make decisions to avoid collisions based on limited information and predicted intention. Therefore, ship-ship collision avoidance can be considered a dynamic imperfect information game. Existing conflict risk assessment methods have focused on the uncertainty of ship motion and did not consider game behavior and the bounded rationality of OOWs. This paper proposes a novel dynamic risk assessment method based on the quantal response equilibrium, a modified game-theory model with imperfect information. Expected utility function is employed to quantify the behavior (yielding or not yielding) benefits, incorporating objective risk, energy loss and predicted intention. The OOWs' behavior probability is predicted by considering perception and intention uncertainties. We develop three stages to describe the OOWs' decisions in different risk zones from conflict formation to the end of collision avoidance. Dynamic conflict risk is estimated by calculating the joint probability that OOWs do not yield when encountering ships in the three stages based on the game theory. Simulations and a case study demonstrate that the method realistically reflects conflict risk and reveals ship characteristics influencing yielding. The results provide information for maritime traffic management and OOW training.{\textless}br/{\textgreater}{\textless}/div{\textgreater} © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

To improve maritime safety management in busy waters, we propose a novel regional ship collision risk assessment approach with the integration of Velocity Obstacle (VO) and complex network in this paper. Firstly, a density-based spatial clustering method is utilized to classify the ships into different clusters, and then a comprehensive collision risk index is proposed. This index combines VO-based time-varying collision risk and network-based complexity measurement of ship encounter situations to estimate the collision risk for single ships. Finally, aiming at assessing the collision risk from multiple perspectives, the Shapley value method is introduced to obtain the macro-regional collision risk by measuring the collision risk contribution of each ship and cluster. To test the performance and feasibility of the proposed approach, a case study was conducted in Zhoushan, China using historical AIS data. The results show that the proposed approach can accurately identify ships with high collision risk and evaluate the spatiotemporal distribution characteristics of collision risk in selected regions, thereby improving the safety management capabilities of maritime surveillance operators.{\textless}br/{\textgreater}{\textless}/div{\textgreater} © 2000-2011 IEEE.},

	abstract = {{\textless}div data-language="eng" data-ev-field="abstract"{\textgreater}The interaction and propagation effects among risk-influencing factors (RIFs) often lead to maritime accidents. Therefore, to support maritime risk management in decision-making, it is imperative to conduct a quantitative risk assessment (QRA) of these accidents, which requires a methodology capable of capturing causal relationships in limited cases. To achieve this goal, this study proposes a data-driven Bayesian network (BN) model that integrates physical knowledge with the QRA. Based on the collected data, a combination of domain knowledge, structure learning, and parameter learning is employed to construct the model. In the data-driven phase, three structural learning algorithms including Bayesian search (BS), Greedy thick thinning (GTT), and Peter-Clark (PC) algorithms, were used in combination with the expectation maximization algorithm of parameter learning. Then, using four indices calculated by the confusion matrix, the most fitting algorithm for structure learning was chosen, and the confusion matrix was obtained by five-fold cross-validation. Finally, network propagation impact (NPI) is introduced to prioritize RIFs. Preventive measures and emergency plans are formulated based on the network resilience metric (NRM) and network vulnerability metric (NVM). This approach leverages the objectivity of a data-driven BN and integrates domain expertise to enhance model validity. A case study of collisions was conducted to demonstrate the applicability of the model. The data were sourced from 327 collision accident reports provided by the China Maritime Safety Administration, and the PC algorithm was chosen. Findings indicate that the "Management system", "Supervision", and "Crew training" RIFs are prioritized for preventive measures, whereas "Communication" receives more resources for emergency handling. The results suggest the formulation of risk management strategies for practitioners to improve maritime safety.{\textless}br/{\textgreater}{\textless}/div{\textgreater} © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

However, risk pertains to the whole life cycle of a ship. In this sense, the operational phase requires methodologies for risk assessment while the vessel is sailing, thus a real-time estimation of the flooding risk. The framework developed during the EU project FLARE for the design phase allows for determining flooding risk by estimating the Potential Loss of Life. Such a metric can be extended to real-time applications thanks to the flexibility of the risk framework. The execution of direct calculations for ship-to-ship collisions and flooding simulations for vessel survivability permit the generation of fast surrogate models to determine potential damage dimensions and survivability for a specific event, thus the flooding risk. Such a process, including uncertainties due to the onboard instrumentations, is applied to two reference passenger ships: a Cruise ship and a RoPax. Simulations of four scenarios considering different weather conditions show the real-time variations of the flooding risk (through the Potential Loss of Life) following collision with a target vessel, thus demonstrating the applicability of the process in real time.{\textless}br/{\textgreater}{\textless}/div{\textgreater} © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

Recent developments in accident prevention and mitigation methods have been bolstered by the rise of autonomous shipping, digital technologies, and Artificial Intelligence (AI). This paper provides an exhaustive review of the characteristics of fleets at risk over the past two decades, emphasizing the societal impacts of preventing collisions and groundings. It also delves into the key components of decision support systems from a ship's perspective and undertakes a systematic literature review on the foundations and applications of systems-driven decision support methods for ship collision and grounding prevention. The study covers risk analysis, damage evaluation, and ship motion prediction methods from 2002 to 2023. The conclusions indicate that modern ship science methods are increasingly valuable in ship design and maritime operations. Emerging multi-physics systems and AI-enabled predictive analytics show potential for future integration into intelligent decision support systems. The strategic research challenges include (1) underestimating the impacts of real operational conditions on ship safety, (2) the inherent limitations of static risk analysis and finite numerical methods, and (3) the need for rapid, probabilistic assessments of damage extents.

Accordingly, this study explores the application of Deep Learning for Ship Collision Risk Evaluation to detect ship collisions. A Collision Risk Index (CRI) between two vessels at a given instance is calculated using AIS data. The environmental impact is captured using an Environmental Factor (Enfactor) index for own and target ships. These indices are combined using different weights to obtain a Resultant that represents collective impact of weather factors on both the ships. Subsequently, CRI and Resultant Enfactor indices are combined using Fuzzy Logic to obtain a comprehensive index called Enhanced Collision Risk Index with Weather (ECRI-W). Various deep learning models are evaluated and the Self-Attention and Intersample Attention Transformer (SAINT) model is selected due to its superior performance with tabular data. The Piraeus AIS and Weather datasets are used for model training and testing. After preprocessing the datasets, the model undergoes self-supervised pretraining and supervised finetuning. It is concluded that SAINT-s variant with pretraining achieves the best performance.{\textless}br/{\textgreater}{\textless}/div{\textgreater} © 2024},
